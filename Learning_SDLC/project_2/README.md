I the following project i created a job Application form that takes in a following amount of data and then submit, during which i learnt the concepts of grid, box-shadow,@media and many more.
Though this i have grasped a basic understanding of built frontend of a website.

This is all possible due to the great playlist of DO SOME CODING (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3GOIx3UqGE&list=PLPppPPmk0i3hZCNmbVtcP1hlwDKOdUFX9&index=3&pp=iAQB)
