This website i made was a parallax website in which the effect of the background picture staying still while the content of the website is moving, through this project i was able to understand the concept of 
flexbox and the comcept of position clearly while also learning the concepts of background image(positioning, attactment, etc).
I am also suprised to tell you that in this task, for the first time i did not follow along the video but did it on my own.

Thanks to DO SOME CODING for providing such excellent resources.
